-- | An additional thread you can initialize and perform 'IO' on.
--
--   The design for this is the idea of keeping a thread alive in between operations
--   and not loading up the trigger thread with things. So, for example, we can just
--   'newBoundChannel', bind the GL context and execute the draw operations sequentially
--   on the thread instead of either making the trigger thread bound and executing
--   operations on it or having to constantly fork around, rebinding the context.
